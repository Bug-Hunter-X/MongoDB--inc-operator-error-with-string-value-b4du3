# MongoDB $inc operator error with string value

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error related to the MongoDB $inc operator. The $inc operator is used to increment a numerical value in a document. However, if you attempt to increment a field with a non-numerical value, you will get an unexpected result.

The bug.js file contains the problematic code, and the bugSolution.js file provides the correct implementation.
